## Why?
I thought this was an opportune project to learn more about CSS attributes/methodologies that I haven't incorporated into personal projects. It helped me understand new concepts and retain new discovery/learnings: namely, [CSS variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/var()) [CSS Grids](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout).

CSS Grids was particularly challenging and I used this [complete guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) to help me achieve some of the layout's challenges. I found the usage of `grid-template-areas` helpful and the ideal way to render the masonry-type layout gallery.

I wasn't exactly going for pixel perfect but a good-enough approximation of the layout build. I also timeboxed myself to _complete_ this in 4-8 hours (on and off in the span of two days).

## Tools Used
- **Adobe XD** [adobe.com/products/xd](https://adobe.com/products/xd)
  - Mainly used for reviewing the comp, inspecting design elements and exporting some of the design assets
- **Icon Fonts** [icofont.com](https://icofont.com)
  - Feels overkill but I needed something quick to display the right arrow and social icons

## Caveats
I only took the Desktop viewport into account. It's _responsive_ to a point. ðŸ˜…

## What's next?
Perhaps if I have a mobile comp to reference, I could definitely iterate and build that next. Also, build the interior/sub pages.
